### Upscaling the MAIZSIM project to the US continental scale

#### The Problem
In the near-term future, population is expected to rise, with a 35% increase by 2050, requiring 50% more food due to changing diets 1. Coincident with this increase in population, climate is also changing — with potentially drastic impacts on food production. A large body of previous work has projected decreases in crop yield under this changing climate — largely due to increasing temperatures 2–5. Most studies, however, have neglected the role of vapor pressure deficit (VPD). A key knowledge gap remains for how crops will respond to rising temperatures versus increasing VPD levels, and the independent mechanisms through which the two climate factors can affect yield. A quantitative understanding of these climate impacts is critical foundational knowledge for selecting optimal plant traits and identifying management practices that can aid adaptation efforts within our agricultural systems under a changing climate.
