< Work log for creating the MAIZSIM weather file >

- 190205:
Finally, I have all the outputs stored in csv files!
- 190129: 
Temporarily stored the temperature & precipitation output as "temp_all.csv" & "precip_all.csv". I'll need to re-run the whole code block since it has errors and currently runs only from 1985-1990, but just in case I wanted to test something with the current output, I thought I'd store the data somewhere for now
- 190120: 
Turns out, there are still many bugs in the loop and the code keeps breaking. Figuring things out.
- 190115: 
Got the overall form of the loop to work, but still need to calculate RH based on temp & temp_dew- 190114: working on writing up the complete for loop!
- 190113: 
Now trying to figure out how to strucutre the xr.ds
- 190112: 
Figured out how to merge each site's weather data into one pd.DataFrame
- 190110: 
Created test code block to try and get the first part of the code to work with xarray
