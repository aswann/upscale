We recommend estimating (either via existing data or domain knowledge) a covariance matrix for your input parameters and then drawing your random parameter vectors such that they obey this correlation. \n",

    "    - (b) not assume that your inputs are normally distributed. \n",
    "- If you are not able to find a python library that implements this method, the simplest option would be to abandon LHS and draw your set of parameter vectors from a multivariate normal distribution. \n",
    "- Drawing from a multivariate normal distribution is straightforward in python provided that you specify a covariance matrix for your parameters. The downside of this approach is that it imposes a specific distribution on your inputs (may not be justified) and it might require more samples than LHS\n",
