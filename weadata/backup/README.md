The .csv files here were the weather files I origianlly processed with some very clumsy and slow code. I updated the code to incorporate some suggestions from Eleanor, which made the code of reading in the raw weather data much faster, cleaner, and more reproducible. 
However, I still wanted to store these old weather files here just in case the outputs turn out to be quite different. 
The row numbers were much smaller in the data generated with the new code since I filtered out only the growing season this time around whereas the weather data files generated previously have data from the whole year.
